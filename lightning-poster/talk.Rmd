## Current Research

> * TOPICS
    - Synthetic Populations
    - Vector Ecology (mostly mosquitos) + Vector Borne Disease
    - Ebola
    - Plant Parasites
    - Flu intervention
    - Rabies
> * APPROACHES
    - general curve model selection / fitting
    - compartment, network, and agent-based models
    - MCMC maximum likelihood fitting

#notes:
# syn. pops is simulating activity to make contact tracing
# vbd work - dengue, jev, chik, focus on seasonality, population surges, vector preference
# ebola - forecasting, model exploration / fitting, vaccination campaign
# plant parasites - general non-linear modeling of development as function of environmental conditions
# flu - cost analysis, absenteeism
# rabies - multispecies compartment models for north american carnivores
```
